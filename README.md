###Enchiridion? 

**Enchiridion (en-ˌkī-ˈri-dē-ən):** A Late Latin term referring to a small manual or handbook.

A wealth of topics are covered throughout the entirety of The Iron Yard's Front-end engineering course each with many great points of reference that can easily get lost in the fog. We wanted to create a canonical point of reference that students can easily refer back to. Beginning a path in programming can have many forks in the road, and this guide is a means to help point you in the right direction.
