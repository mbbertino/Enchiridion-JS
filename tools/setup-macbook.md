# Setup a new Macbook
Setting up a new dev environment on a computer doesn't (generally) have to be a nightmare. While it's possible to use a pre-fab setup, it's important to know how to do it from scratch. Here's a simple checklist that will at least get you up and running on OS X. 

**NOTE**: Remember, if you're asked to paste a command into your terminal, don't paste the dollar-sign ($) at the beginning; it's only meant to indicate that you paste the text into a terminal prompt :)

* Download and install Xcode from the App Store.
* In Xcode under Prefrences > Downloads, install the Command Line Tools (this includes the GCC compiler you'll need for Homebrew)
* Install Homebrew[^1]
* Install iTerm2[^2], which is superior to the built-in OS X Terminal.app
* Make sure you have a GitHub account, and follow the SSH setup instructions[^3]
* Download Sublime Text[^4]
* Add Package Control to Sublime[^5]
* Install oh-my-zsh to spice up your terminal[^6]. Especially useful for seeing Git status info.
* Install Chrome, Chrome Canary, Firefox, and Firefox Nightly
* Install LimeChat[^7], join irc.freenode.net, and read up on IRC[^8]. The `#html5`, `#css`, and `##javascript` channels are going to become your new home ;)  

If you've completed everything on the list, you should be good for now. You'll almost certainly have to do more setup later, but this guarantees that you'll be able to use Homebrew, Git, etc to install more tools later.

Don't be afraid of the terminal (also known as the command line). While you can do some serious damage to your computer if you make a series of wrong moves, it's generally a very helpful tool, and in many cases, the only way to interact with non-GUI programs.
